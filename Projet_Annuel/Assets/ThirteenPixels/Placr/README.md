# About Placr
Placr increases your level design speed by letting you place objects quickly.

It allows you to select a prefab (or a 3d model asset) and place it multiple times in your scene by simply clicking where it's supposed to go.
This way, you can enrich your scene with hand-placed rocks, foliage, buildings, debris etc. in a much quicker fashion that dragging them into the scene view one by one.
