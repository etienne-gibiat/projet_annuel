-= Text Mesh Pro Support =-

If you are using TextMeshPro and you would like to also use the Better-TextMeshPro features, 
you have to install the Better UI Textmesh Pro package additionally.
you can find it at Assets/TheraBytes/BetterUI/BetterUI_TextMeshPro_v<X.Y.Z>.unitypackage

Note: If you are using Unity 2020+ you most likely need the package 3.0.1. 
However, just import the package for version 1.0.54.
If you see compile errors in the console import the 3.0.1 package afterwards.
